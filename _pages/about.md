I am a PhD candidate in **Biomedical Engineering (concentration in Medical Imaging)** at **Illinois Institute of Technology**, working under the supervision of **[Prof. Konstantinos Arfanakis](https://www.iit.edu/directory/people/konstantinos-arfanakis)** in the **[MRIIT](https://www5.iit.edu/~mri/Home.html)** Lab, which is part of the **Medical Imaging & Artificial Intelligence Research Center**, and collaborating with the **[Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research-rush-university/departmental-research/rush-alzheimers-disease-center)** on age-related neuropathologies. Previously, I completed my BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at **[Islamic University of Technology](https://iutoic-dhaka.edu/)**, Bangladesh, where I conducted my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of **[Prof. Golam Sarowar](https://eee.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/asim/education)**.

My research focuses on **autopsy-validated MRI, PET, and blood-based biomarkers** to characterize:
- Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change (**ADNC**)
- Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (**LATE-NC**)
- **Cerebrovascular diseases** like Arteriolosclerosis, Atherosclerosis and Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA)

## What I do

Broadly, I develop **machine learning models** and **method pipelines** that link **in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI** with **neuropathology** and **cognition**, with the goal of building deployable biomarkers that generalize across **scanners, sites, and cohorts**. [**Check out our Tangles Marker!**](https://kingkhalid310.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/) For related work from our lab, see **ARTS** **[Paper](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70430)** | [**[Software](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/arts)** (in-vivo MRI marker for arteriolosclerosis)] and **MARBLE** **[Paper](https://archive.ismrm.org/2025/0872.html)** (in-vivo MRI marker for LATE).

This includes work on:
- MRI‑based markers of **neurofibrillary tangles**, translating autopsy‑grounded signatures into tools that can be used in living cohorts. 
- Quantifying brain structure and atrophy patterns to separate and combine the effects of **Alzheimer’s disease**, **LATE**, and **cerebrovascular diseases**.
- Tracking **vascular** and **neurodegenerative diseases** over time, integrating **imaging** and **blood biomarkers** to understand progression and its impact on **cognition**.

## I’m excited about places where these tools can be used to

- Clean up heterogeneity in **Alzheimer’s and mixed-pathology trials**
- Design efficient **MRI- and blood-based screening and staging** strategies
- Translate pathology-grounded imaging markers into robust, **containerized software** that collaborators can run on their own infrastructure

## How I work

I’m a visual problem-solver — I think in sketches. Before I code, I draw the pipeline: figures, logic, and failure points. Clarity first. Keyboard second.

## Beyond the lab

I believe in **[Slow Science](http://slow-science.org/)** - good questions take time to mature.

I trust a Matador pen and an A4 paper checklist more than any productivity app.

Currently, I’m re-reading Austin Kleon’s **[Show Your Work!](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/)** - a personal favorite.

I’m also constantly searching for the best chai or qahwa spots in the city; if you know a great Yemeni café, please send the recommendation my way.

## Connect

I am currently in the final stages of my PhD (**expected defense: April 2026**) and am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities in multimodal neuroimaging and biomarkers.
